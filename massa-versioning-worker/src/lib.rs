//! # General description
//! MIP = Massa Improvement proposal (similar to Bitcoin Improvement Proposal - BIP or Ethereum - EIP)
//!
//! MIPInfo -> represent a MIP (name, versions, time ranges)
//! MIPState -> Deployment state of a MIPInfo
//! MIPStore -> A map of MIPInfo -> MipState
//!
//! # Note on MipInfo versions
//!
//! There is 2 different versions:
//! * version -> Network version -> This is the network version to announce and thus to store in block header
//! * component_version -> This is the version for the associated component and is used in VersioningFactory
//!
//! # Note on MipState
//!
//! MipState has:
//! * A state machine (stores the current state of deployment for a MipInfo)
//! * A history (stores a list of `Advance` message that 'really' updated the state machine)
//!
//! History is there in order to:
//! * Query the state at any time, so you can query MipStore and ask the best version at any time
//! * Used a lot when merging 2 MipStore:
//!   * By replaying the history of the states of the received MipStore (bootstrap), we can safely updates in the bootstrap process
//!   * + When we init MipStore (at startup), this ensures that we have a time ranges & versions coherent list of MipInfo
//!     * For instance, this can avoid to have 2 MipInfo with the same name
//!
//! # Advancing MipState
//!
//! The Versioning middleware is designed to process all finalized blocks and update the corresponding state
//! **It is not yet implemented**
//!
//! # VersioningFactory
//!
//! A Factory trait is there to ease the development of factory for Versioned component (e.g. address, block)
//!
//! All factories should query MIPStore in order to create a component with correct version; default implementation
//! are provided by the trait to avoid re writing theses query functions.
//!
//! Unit tests in versioning_factory.rs shows a basic but realistic implementation of a AddressFactory (impl the Factory trait)
